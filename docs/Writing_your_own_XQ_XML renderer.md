## Writing your own XQ-XML renderer
You can write your own XQ-XML rederer. The easiest way is to use pure javascript (See some examples here). You may also use XSLT files to transform your XQ-XML into HTML (See examples here). There are other ways, of course, for instance you can use XML functions in databases to convert your XQ-XML into tabular data.
