## About XQ-XML Tag attributes

Notice that in the example above, some of the tags had titles e.g. <QuestionSets title="Three Tests for my students">. "title" is one of the attributes you can put on a tag to specify more information for processing the XQ-XML file. For the sake of simplicity, all titles are optional. However this means that tags without attributes will have default behaviour. But if you want to really customise your questions, then you need to use attributes. You will see the list of applicable attributes for each tag later on in this document.
